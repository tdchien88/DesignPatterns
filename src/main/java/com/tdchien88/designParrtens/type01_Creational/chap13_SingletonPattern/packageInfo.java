/**
 * 
 * Singleton design pattern in Java
 * 
 * Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance
 * and provides a global point of access to it".
 * 
 * In other words, a class must ensure that only single instance should be
 * created and single object can be used by all other classes.
 * 
 * There are two forms of singleton design pattern
 * 
 * Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time.
 * 
 * Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.
 * 
 * Advantage of Singleton design pattern
 * 
 * Saves memory because object is not created at each request. Only single
 * instance is reused again and again.
 * 
 * Usage of Singleton design pattern
 * 
 * Singleton pattern is mostly used in multi-threaded and database applications.
 * It is used in logging, caching, thread pools, configuration settings etc.
