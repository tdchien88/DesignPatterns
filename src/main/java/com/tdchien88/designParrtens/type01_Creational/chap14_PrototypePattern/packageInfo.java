/**
 * Prototype Pattern says that cloning of an existing object instead of creating
 * new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.
 * 
 * This pattern should be followed, if the cost of creating a new object is
 * expensive and resource intensive.
 * 
 * Advantage of Prototype Pattern
 * 
 * The main advantages of prototype pattern are as follows:
 * 
 * It reduces the need of sub-classing.
 * 
 * It hides complexities of creating objects.
 * 
 * The clients can get new objects without knowing which type of object it will
 * be.
 * 
 * It lets you add or remove objects at runtime.
 * 
 * # Usage of Prototype Pattern
 * 
 * _ When the classes are instantiated at runtime.
 * 
 * _ When the cost of creating an object is expensive or complicated.
 * 
 * _ When you want to keep the number of classes in an application minimum.
 * 
 * _ When the client application needs to be unaware of object creation and
 * representation.
