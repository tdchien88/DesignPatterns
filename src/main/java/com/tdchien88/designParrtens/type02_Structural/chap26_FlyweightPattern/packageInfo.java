 * objects by storing them and create new object when no matching object is
 * found".

 * 
 * It reduces the amount of memory and storage devices required if the objects
 * are persisted
 * 
 * Usage of Flyweight Pattern

 * 
 * _ When the storage cost is high because of the quantity of objects.
 * 
 * _ When the application does not depend on object identity.
