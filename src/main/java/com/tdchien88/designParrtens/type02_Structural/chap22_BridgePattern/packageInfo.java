/**
 * A Bridge Pattern says that just "decouple the functional abstraction from the
 * implementation so that the two can vary independently".
 * 
 * The Bridge Pattern is also known as Handle or Body.
 * 
 * Advantage of Bridge Pattern
 * 
 * It enables the separation of implementation from the interface.
 * 
 * It improves the extensibility.
 * 
 * It allows the hiding of implementation details from the client.
 * 
 * Usage of Bridge Pattern
 * 
 * _ When you don't want a permanent binding between the functional abstraction
 * and its implementation.
 * 
 * _ When both the functional abstraction and its implementation need to extended
 * using sub-classes.
 * 
 * _ It is mostly used in those places where changes are made in the
 * implementation does not affect the clients.
