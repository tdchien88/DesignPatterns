 * another interface that a client wants".
 * 
 * In other words, to provide the interface according to client requirement
 * while using the services of a class with a different interface.
 * 
 * The Adapter Pattern is also known as Wrapper.
 * 
 * Advantage of Adapter Pattern
 * 
 * It allows two or more previously incompatible objects to interact.
 * 
 * It allows reusability of existing functionality.
 * 
 * Usage of Adapter pattern:
 * 
 * It is used:
 * 
 * When an object needs to utilize an existing class with an incompatible
 * interface.
 * 
 * When you want to create a reusable class that cooperates with classes which
 * don't have compatible interfaces.
